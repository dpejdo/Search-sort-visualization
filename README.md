# Search and Sort Algorithm Visualization in React

## Project Overview

This is a toy project aimed at visualizing popular search and sorting algorithms using React. The project provides an interactive way to explore how these algorithms work step-by-step with real-time visual feedback.

## Features

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Visualizes common sorting algorithms such as:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Heap Sort
- **Search Algorithms**: Visualizes common search algorithms such as:
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search
  - Exponential Search
  - Jump Search
  - Interpolation Search
- Real-time visualization of algorithm steps
- Adjustable array sizes

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Project

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will open the project in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- Select an algorithm from the dropdown menu.
- Adjust the array size as desired.
- Click "Start" to begin the visualization.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface
- **CSS**: For styling and animations
- **JavaScript**: For algorithm implementations

## Notes

- Refactored version of code on `feature/generator-func`, using generators to display swaps and actions of sorting
